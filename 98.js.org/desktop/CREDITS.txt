This is Paziwon's portfolio, and I want to express my gratitude to Angela Yu for her excellent teaching, which enabled me to create and integrate my very first portfolio. This is the start of my journey, and I’m excited to work on more projects in the future.

Feel free to explore the games and features here. If you have suggestions for additional games or features, let me know—I’ll make sure to add them!

Additionally, I plan to incorporate coding into my accounting career. My goal is to gain a thorough understanding of finance and accounting while building software that makes work easier for everyone.
